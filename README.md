# EOS Nation - Ambassadors üë®‚Äçüëß‚Äçüë¶

This document will define what is an EOS Nation Ambassador and its implications and what it takes to become one if you choose to.

## What is an EOS Nation Ambassador?

> EOS Nation wants to educate people about this new technology. As a Block Producer, we want to encourage the creation of events to inform the public about the good things that the EOS protocol will bring to our society. We want to encourage people in the community to contribute to the movement by hosting engagement sessions around the world. We also aim to create informative content that would be accessible to everyone, no matter where they reside, while being available in multiple languages so that everyone can promote the EOS ecosystem. This is where Ambassadors comes in to play. An Ambassador is a person that is excited about the EOS project and that wants to contribute to the community by hosting events in their jurisdiction. It can either be a EOS Meetup or any other blockchain event that can promote the EOS blockchain. EOS Nation will provide powerpoint presentations, text and step by step guides that explain how to create a Meetup or host big events. All that content wont be ready right away and it can always be improved so we would appreciate all the help we can get from the community.

## What it takes to be an EOS Nation Ambassador?

>You never know what is going to happen as a result to following your passion. Meetups are just the first step.
Meetups will allow you to meet people as passionate as you about EOS and with different skill set. Toguether, you can build big things that you would never would of tought possible without having brainstormed with these people. EOS Nation is looking for motivated people that are excited and passionate about the project and that would be able to host meetups idealy once a month. We are looking for around 2-3 EOS Nation Ambassadors per city that would cooperate in the creation of the Meetups. If you feel that your skillset would be better used in the main EOS Nation Team, we invite you to submit your canidacy in the Members repository.
