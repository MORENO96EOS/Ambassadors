### Bio

Eat, sleep, crypto. Like many others on the EOS Nation team, I am passionate about crypto and the future that EOS will bring. I have been focusing on EOS full-time since early January 2018. I began my journey into computers at a very young age, building my first computer at 6 years old. I have always had a deep ideological relationship with computers and their role in a decentralized future. I began my university studies in software engineering, but quickly realized the human aspect was where my heart resided. After completing studies in psychology and pure sciences, I bridged the gap by focusing on perceptual and computational neuropsychology. In my professional life, I bring my background to organizations looking to create autonomous efficiencies and effectiveness to processes using technology. When I am not in front of a computer, I am an avid reader, a lover of the outdoors - some of you may have crossed me on one of my many backcountry expeditions - and a world traveller. I am fluent in Japanese having spent the early part of my formative adult years living in Japan.

### Bio

The path that has led me to EOS is not a common one. After studying business administration at Ottawa University, I found myself  working a job that did not inspire me, surrounded mostly by people I did not enjoy being around.  Waking up in the morning depressed at the thought of another day, I eventually left my federal government job.  I stopped listening to what others thought I should do and started listening to what I wanted to do. It's been a wild ride and it feels like my life-satisfaction graph went parabolic, constantly reaching new all time highs. I've been able to use one of my passions, poker, to fuel my other passions in life which include hanging out with friends, traveling, sports, learning and all sorts of summer and winter back-country adventures. 

I also enjoy learning about psychology, behavioral-economics, incentives and game theory. Striving to always be game theory optimal at the poker table has transferred over to many other areas of my life. Falling in love with the ideology and efficiency of cryptoassets felt very natural once I started going down the rabbit hole of crypto knowledge. 

I thought cryptographically secured networks of value was an amazing idea and started to invest in cryptos in early 2017. To verify my investment thesis, I turned my facebook profile into a daily source of crypto teaser posts. My goal was to get people curious enough to chat with me so I could teach them what I knew about cryptoassets and decentralization. I wanted to see if others would agree with my views. I was delightfully pleased by the response.   Once I explained my philosophy behind cryptos, nearly everyone I talked to agreed with me and thanked me for taking the time to educate them. Having confirmed my investment thesis, I poured as much time and money as I could into crypto and kept educating myself.  

Moving forward, I want to invest my capital and time into helping create the decentralized world we all dream of. I enjoy educating people on cryptoassets and I am very excited to focus my efforts on growing the EOS community through education and community outreach in 2018 and beyond.

Inspired by Dan Larimer, I also commit myself to helping build free market solutions to secure life, liberty and property for all.

### Bio

Where to start… I don’t really have a background in programming or coding but I have always been interested by the technology side. I Was a huge gamer when I was at a younger age and I’ve try to learn how coding but it wasn’t really for me. After college, I have acquired some experience in project managing for a construction company. I’ve finishes my Master degree in architecture last year and now currently working as an Architect graduate in the biggest architecture agency in Gatineau. 

I am also the co-founder of Cryptek. Cryptek is aiming to build content in French to educate the community about Cryptocurrency and Blockchain technology. We also organizing meetup to share our knowledge and the ideology of the Blockchain technology.

In 2008, my research lead me deep down the rabbit hole. It is at this moment that I realise how our world is corrupt and how bad it is governed. I’ve always wanted to find a way to change the world and try to make it a better place. Deep in me I’ve always been a Libertarian without really knowing it. 

In 2011, I heard Bitcoin for the first time, but like everyone else, I didn’t really see is potential was at first glance.  Last year I heard about it again and I’ve start studying Bitcoin and Blockchain technology. At this moment, I got hooked up and couldn’t stop learning and consume as much information I could on the subject. I have no doubt that this technology will have a great impact on our live and on our society. 
	
My main goal is someday to give full time commitment to the crypto space and try to share to the community the vision of decentralization and how it will impact our world positively. I also highly preaching the vision of Dan Larimer for a non-violence society that is self-governed and where everyone life and property are properly secured.

## Bio

I’ve lived in Texas all my life and am of Hispanic heritage, a 3rd generation college graduate and earned an MBA in 2011, acquired experience in education/education administration and worked business startups in education and design.  I’ve had an eye in the blockchain space for a while, the first opportunity I missed was not buying Bitcoin when I saw it at $2, I started getting interested in it again when it dropped below $500 and have been investing in the space ever since.   I followed big names in the industry (Andreas Antonopoulos) and was a bitcoin maximalist for a long time, then I realized Bitcoin was no longer making sense as a P2P money or scaling solution due to miner control and fees.  I came across EOS just for the mere fact that It was relatively cheap, just dropping from just above $5.  I jumped in at about $1.75 and double down every time it dropped (closely following the project)… so yea 100% of my cryptfolio is EOS.  I’ve always been a saver and investor but never really made money until the cryptoworld came around… I was and still am convinced that markets are manipulated.  I Iived through the Internet boom, housing bust, and Financial Crisis, am an original RON PAUL 2008 supporter and am driven to study free market economics, a big fan of Peter Schiff, Marc Faber & Milton Friedman.  I also enjoy and try to stay on the forefront of technology (some experience in web design & coding), so when I saw the man Dan Larimer come about (boom) All in (free market solutions).  I see Dan Larimer as the Steve Jobs of Crypto.  Other than this, I’m a pretty basic guy with a passion for business development and community growth and engagement.  Behind every great project is are great people and a community to support them.

### Bio

<p>Born, raised and living in Toronto.
Earned a Bachelor of Journalism from Ryerson University in 2009.

Woken out of slumber during an LSD trip in university, inspired to live a life dedicated to the values of Truth, Love, and Freedom. Like a lonely leaf on a branch suddenly discovering I’m attached to a beautiful tree.

Worked briefly as a chase producer for Global TV.

Been working in Financial Technology for the past 10 years in various capacities: customer service, sales, sales coaching, agent training, digital marketing, digital process management (LEAN green belt), and digital messaging product management (certified scrum master, certified product owner). At work I'm known for my customer focus, technology expertise, relationship building skills, and ability to bring those together to design great digital customer experiences.

I was briefly director of operations and marketing at a blockchain consulting firm, but I walked away because I wasn’t a fan of the private ledger direction they were heading in. (Ethereum wasn't able to satisfy any practical business use cases - that's when I started looking for opportunities in the EOS community).

In my free time, I like to learn about Austrian Economics, technology (especially blockchain), and the philosophy of ethics. I enjoy time with my thoughts in nature, as well as making genuine connections with my community. I'm by no means a developer, but I have some aptitude for coding. I coded my first website in the 7th grade on a hand-me-down Mac clone. I've since lost touch with my HTML skills, but have some pretty mean wordpress game. I've dabbled with SQL at work, and have recently started learning C++.

Like our friend Dan Larimer, I’d like to dedicate myself to creating free market solutions to secure life, liberty and property.

I recently started the [EOS Toronto meetup](http://meetup.com/eos-toronto/) and have been working with bluejays from EOS Go and some others to grow that community.</p>
